This is the first commit of the readme


Stages of project will be:
1. Prepare dataset by merging all the training data csv files [DONE]
2. Prepare the pipelines [ALMOST DONE]
3. Define the metrics used to analyze the data (MSE) [ALMOST DONE]
4. Define a few parameters for finding the best hyperparameters (for KNN, RandomForset, MLP, SVM) [ALMOST DONE]
5. Do the pipelines and the gridsearchCV with TimeSeriesSplit as cv [DONE]
6. For each "best" estimator model with the best hyperparameters, run the estimators on the final test set (last week of april)
7. Plot stuff up

DONE
